The player must choose one of about five circuits to work on in one of the ship's critical systems: Engine, Power, Communications, Life Support, and the HAL 9000. Successful power routing of a circuit makes each system slowly come on-line. It takes three powered circuits for minimum function, but four provides more leeway for success. On-Line engines and power can be activated for an orbital boost, but too long a burn will damage circuit components. HAL 9000 can power undamaged circuits you assign to him, although at a much slower pace than the player. Communications allow a powered HAL 9000 to inform you of success/failure at powering a circuit assigned to him. Life Support gives more protection against EMPs damaging powered circuits, which require repair and repowering."

Up to four players compete in the ten different events of a real-life decathlon, either in sequence or individually.\r\n\r\nThe game became somewhat notorious for the amount of wear or damage inflicted upon console controllers,[citation needed] namely the Atari 2600 version where rapid back-and-forth movement of the joystick propels the athlete down the track.\r\n\r\nThe game was later reissued simply as Decathlon by the UK budget label Firebird.[1] It was subsequently featured on the PlayStation 2 compilation Activision Anthology."

Some enemies can be shot while others are out of reach. Fuel is limited and needs to replenished by collecting refreshments dropped by allied planes. Level three is similar; the player uses a hang glider now. There are different enemies to fight and no fuel to collect. In level four, there is a guarded energy field to cross in order to bring four bombs to the other side. However, only one bomb can be transported at once and there is a time limit.\r\n\r\nAfter beating all four levels, they loop with more difficult enemies and faster playing speed. The player can take nine hits and the overall goal is to earn as many points as possible before the unavoidable final death occurs."

When deciding on your shot, you will need to take the current conditions into account, which includes wind speed/direction and any mountains that may get in your way. Successfully destroying your opponents gun will earn you a point, and the first player to reach the set number of points wins the game.

The player defends against centipedes, spiders, scorpions and fleas, completing a round after eliminating the centipede that winds down the playing field.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe player is represented by a small, \"somewhat humanoid head\"[1] at the bottom of the screen, later depicted as a caped, elf-like character on the Atari 2600, Atari 5200 and Atari 7800 cartridge graphics (though described as being a garden gnome in the trivia section of the cell phone interpretation). The player moves the character about the bottom area of the screen with a trackball and fires laser shots at a centipede advancing from the top of the screen down through a field of mushrooms. Shooting any section of the centipede creates a mushroom; shooting one of the middle segments splits the centipede into two pieces at that point. Each piece then continues independently on its way down the board, with the first section of the rear piece becoming a new head. If the head is destroyed, the section behind it becomes the next head.\r\n\r\nThe centipede starts at the top of the screen, traveling either left or right. When it hits a mushroom or the edge of the screen, it drops one level and switches direction. Thus, more mushrooms on the screen cause the centipede to descend more rapidly. The player can destroy mushrooms by shooting them, but each takes four hits to destroy.\r\n\r\n\r\nCentipede-Arcade\r\nIf the centipede reaches the bottom of the screen, it moves back and forth within the player area and one-segment \"head\" centipedes are periodically added. This continues until the player has eliminated both the original centipede and all heads. When all the centipede's segments are destroyed, a new centipede forms at the top of the screen. Every time a centipede is eliminated, however, the next one is one segment shorter and is accompanied by one additional, fast-moving \"head\" centipede.\r\n\r\nThe player is also menaced by other creatures besides the centipedes. Fleas drop vertically, leaving additional mushrooms in their path; they appear when fewer than five mushrooms are in the player movement area, though the number required increases with level of difficulty. Spiders move across the player area in a zig-zag fashion and occasionally eat some of the mushrooms. Scorpions move horizontally across the screen and poison every mushroom they touch, but these never appear in the player movement region. A centipede touching a poisoned mushroom hurtles straight down toward the player area, then returns to normal behavior upon reaching it.\r\n\r\nA player loses a life when hit by a centipede or another enemy, such as a spider or a flea, after which any poisoned or partially damaged mushrooms revert to normal. Points are awarded for each regenerated mushroom."

While not the first game to feature two-player cooperative play, Joust was more successful than its predecessors and popularized the concept. The player uses a button and joystick to control a knight riding a flying ostrich. The object is to progress through levels by defeating groups of enemy knights riding buzzards.\r\n\r\nJohn Newcomer led the development team, which included Bill Pfutzenreuter, Jan Hendricks, Python Anghelo, Tim Murphy, and John Kotlarik. Newcomer aimed to create a flying game with cooperative two-player gameplay, but wanted to avoid a space theme, which was popular at the time. Staff worked within the technical limitations of the hardware (originally developed two years earlier for Williams' first game, Defender), excluding concepts and optimizing the visuals.\r\n\r\nThe game was well received in arcades and by critics, who praised the gameplay. The gameplay mechanics influenced titles by other developers. Joust was followed by a sequel four years later, and was ported to numerous home and portable platforms.\r\n\r\nThe ColecoVision version of Joust was never released officially by AtariSoft in 1983, game was done but with no sound."

The game takes place in a castle filled with platforms and ladders, some of which can be flipped from one platform to another. The player controls Mr. Do as he collects cherries by using a hammer to knock out blocks that contain them from the various platforms. Empty holes left by the knocked-out blocks serve as traps for the monsters - if a monster falls into a hole, the player can then defeat it by causing a block above the monster to fall on top of it. If the player takes too long to complete a level, the monsters transform into faster, more difficult forms that occasionally multiply. The game advances to the next level when all cherries on the level have been collected or all enemies have been defeated. The player loses a life if Mr. Do is caught by a monster, and the game ends when the player runs out of lives. The game is an example of the trap-em-up genre, which also includes games like Heiankyo Alien, Lode Runner, Boomer's Adventure in Asmik World, and Space Panic.\r\n\r\nAs in Mr. Do!, the player can earn an extra life by collecting all of the letters from the word \"EXTRA\". Regular monsters can be changed into monsters bearing the EXTRA letters by collecting all three keys distributed around the playfield and then picking up a magic shield from the top floor. Monsters in this state are easier to defeat than normal; a simple hammer strike will do the job. After a brief interval, they change back into their normal forms. The game also offers a bonus credit for collecting a rare diamond that appears on the playfield at random intervals.\r\n\r\nThe cherry blocks are absent from Mr. Do Vs. Unicorns and early revisions of Mr. Do's Castle. Instead, blocks that are not keys or skulls at the start of a stage will be fill blocks (those left behind when unicorns fall into holes and are left alone for a time). Because of this, there are only three ways to complete a level in this version, versus the four ways to complete levels in Mr. Do's Castle.

There are two types of enemies that must be avoided: \"Roaming Eyes\" and the \" Whippersnapper\" who unzips all uncompleted, zipped segments by moving over them.

Once See the videoyou’ve baked the snake, you land your sled on the surface and have a shootout with Gryptogg, Raygoth and Arkus. Once you’ve beaten them back, you can explore the underground caverns, collecting their instruments of evil and exchanging fire with them again. When you escape from their maze, you advance to the next level and begin the fight anew. (North American Philips / Probe 2000, 1983 – unreleased)\r\n\r\nThis Colecovision adaptation of the Odyssey2 game (now there’s a phrase you’re never going to see again), based on a less-than-blockbuster-successful series of comics and action figures, adds more depth to the game than the dear old Odyssey ever could’ve managed. But it’s hard to tell how much depth, as the game was never completed.\r\n\r\nThe “snake” screen, though it’s much more impressive visually than its counterpart on the Odyssey2, is just plain boring. The O2 edition of Power Lords also forced you to dodge earthbound meteors and an “artificial black hole” within the volcano that could drag you to your doom if you got on a horizontal line of sight with it when it opened. On the Colecovision, all you have to contend with are enemy vehicles and a slow-moving snake. It takes more time than effort to clear this screen, and it’s ultimately a bit boring.\r\n\r\nThe other screens, which aren’t even hinted at in the Odyssey2 version of the game, are also a bit tedious – enemy A.I. and combat programming obviously weren’t finished when the game was abandoned. You can exchange fire with your interestingly-animated opponents, but sometimes they just stop firing and disappear. Convenient, sure, but not terribly exciting.\r\n\r\n“Probe 2000” was an imprint – akin to Atari’s “Atarisoft” division – opened by North American Philips to release games for hardware other than the Odyssey2, which was by now firmly into its twilight. The only game actually released by Probe 2000 was War Room, programmed by Bob “RoSHa” Harris (who created Killer Bees on the O2). Probe 2000’s next release would’ve been either Power Lords or the impressive RPG Lord Of The Dungeon (which was left in limbo because its battery-backed-up cartridge, capable of saving the player’s position, was an idea that just wouldn’t be practical until the NES era).  The intellectual property rights to Pink Panther had been snagged by N.A.P. for the Odyssey2 and other systems, but the only version of that game that has ever surfaced has been an incredibly rare Atari 2600 prototype.

You control Q*Bert on the playfield of blocks; Q*Bert changes the colors by jumping to a block which will cause it to rotate in the direction of his jump.

You begin your quest outside the temple; climb your way up the side of the temple in order to get inside. Poisonous snakes and deadly lightning bolts will block your progress here. Once inside the temple, you have a limited air supply so you need to explore quickly.\r\nHidden in various rooms of the temple are numerous keys which are needed to unlock the vault. The keys and some other useful items are hidden in secret rooms which you need to locate by using your trusty pick axe or the flasks of acid you carry. To help figure out which rooms may contain hidden objects, you carry a geiger counter with you; the higher the reading, the closer you are to something of interest.\r\nThe rooms you'll be exploring are guarded by snakes, spiders, and even mummies. To deal with these enemies you carry a gun, and you can also use the acid flasks against them (ammo is limited, so use it wisely). If you are successful in your mission, you may receive a secret code which can be used to begin the game at later levels."

Along the way he had to avoid ferocious man-sized dinosaurs and belligerent red-haired cavemen against whom he had no direct means of offense. The only ways to defeat the opponents were either temporary (dazing them with the flashlight) or indirect (waiting for them to be suspended on a harpoon rope to make them fall down), an element which added a certain amount of trickiness to the game, unusual for its time. Bonus items to collect along the way included fallen phoenix feathers and phoenix eggs, which granted the player invulnerability from the prehistoric denizens for a short period of time.\r\n\r\nRoc'n Rope was ported to the Atari 2600 and ColecoVision. The ColecoVision version was more faithful to the original, while the Atari port was rudimentary at best."

One source argues that the graphics in the 1981 game Defender would count, and Taito's Jungle Hunt side-scroller, released the same year as Moon Patrol, also features parallax scrolling."

      "en": "This years’ Classic Gaming Expo and the 10th Anniversary of Digital Press happen to coincide. Obviously, DP wanted to do something special to mark the occasion. What better way than to release an original game for a classic system? Several game developers were contacted, but the job went to Daniel Bienvenu, who had written a few homebrews for ColecoVision (BUSTin Out, Dac-Man). Joe Santulli came up with the title and concept and provided support. A lot of people pitched in to help. Daniel brought in Sylvain (‘Sly DC’) De Chantal to design most of the levels and assist with the graphics. Marcel de Kogel wrote the emulator the game was compiled and tested on. As the project neared completion, Dave Giarrusso designed the artwork for the label and the instruction manual (as well as the full page advertisement shown in the last issue of DP as well as the CGE2K1 show program). Even veteran homebrew author John Dondzila lent his expertise on coding and debugging the program. Most of the communication and brainstorming was done via the Internet through email and instant messenger—something the designers of old didn’t have at their disposal.\r\n\r\nFinally, when the game was complete there were ten levels. After the game was downloaded to a ROM, it was discovered that it wouldn’t load an the actual console! After nearly giving coordinator Santulli a heart attack, John Dondzila was consulted and solved the problem. During his testing there were issues that had to be addressed such as heavy flickering and fatal errors. These were eventually worked out, and Santulli survived from near-coronary condition. Ironically when the bugs were fixed it freed up a lot of storage, so an additional ten levels were eventually added. There was not much time left but Santulli, with the aid of fellow CGE organizer and DP guy John Hardie managed to do the soldering and construction of 40 cartridges in time for a Classic Gaming Expo release.\r\n\r\nWhen the scheduled release time arrived at the show a long queue had formed. The games sold out within ten minutes. Even the promotional posters (with Dave G’s artwork) were taken. Most Expo-goers managed to at least play the demo that was set up. Their comments were consistently positive."

There are four customers, each has its own lane lengthier than the previous one, whom you have to keep at bay. If they reach the end of the lane without receiving their beer, you're a goner; if you miss one and accidentally spill beer needlessly you lose a life and should one of them throw you back the mug and you fail to catch it, you lose a life as well."
