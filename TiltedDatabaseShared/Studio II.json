      "en": "Space War consists of two shooting games: Horizontal Intercept and Vertical Intercept.\r\n\r\nIn Horizontal Intercept, the player has to destroy enemy spaceships with the use of rockets. The spaceships pass by horizontally and the player launches his rockets from the bottom of the screen. Once the rocket is in the air he can steer it left or right. The player has 20 rockets and the goal is simply to score as many points as possible. Some spaceships move faster and will therefore give more points, and there are both big and small spaceships, the latter being worth more points.\r\n\r\nVertical Intercept is a one-button game for two players. Each player controls a missile launcher on each side of the screen and in between them an enemy spaceship moves up and down. The player's missile climbs when the player holds down the button and drops when he releases it. The game ends when the spaceship hits a marker at the top of the screen 8 times. Hitting the spaceship makes it reverse its direction, so the game can be prolonged."

      "en": "TV Arcade IV: Baseball is an adaptation of the sport for two-player. When one player is batting the other pitches and controls the movement of the fielders. A game starts with the pitcher pressing one of three keys: 5 for a straight pitch, 2 for an inside curve, and 8 for an outside curve. Holding any of the keys down leads to a changeup. The batter then has to swing the bat by pressing the 5 key. After a hit, the defending player can move the fielders up and down to attempt catching the ball. The movement of runners is automatic. The player with the highest score after nine innings wins the game. If it is a tie, up to 99 extra innings can be played or until a player gets 99 runs."

      "en": "TV Casino I: Blackjack is a card game based on the Las Vegas version of Blackjack. It can be played by one or two players against a dealer. Each player starts out with a stake of $200 and must, before each hand, place a bet between $1 and $10. Like in the real card game the aim is to get a card count that totals 21 or as close to it as possible without going above it. After being dealt the player has three choices: hit, double, or stand. A winning player gets paid an amount equal to the bet and if succeeding with getting a two-card natural 21 the payoff is two times the bet. The game ends when a player reaches $999 or when both players lose all money."

      "en": "TV Arcade II: Fun with Numbers is a cartridge containing three games:\r\n\r\n- Guess the Number (1 Player): The game randomly determines a three-digit number that the player has to guess. It has to be done in twenty turns or less and for each guess, the game gives a clue in the form of a number 000 to 006. 000 means no digits are right and 006 that the guess is right. 001 means one digit is right but in the wrong position and 002 means one position is right or that two digits are right but in the wrong position. 003-006 is for any feasible combination of the previous two.\r\n\r\n- Guess the Number (2 Players): Same as above but with two human players who start with entering their own numbers. They then take turns making guesses until one player correctly guesses the opponent's number.\r\n\r\n- Reverse (1 Player): The player is presented with a randomly scrambled sequence of the numbers 1 to 9 and has to rearrange the numbers so that the numeral sequence is created. This is done by reversing a selected group of numbers. For example, pressing the 2 key reverses the first two numbers while the 9 key reverses the whole sequence. The player has 30 moves to complete the puzzle."

The first three levels are arithmetic problems while the fourth levels involve elementary algebra."
