Your mission is to fly the mothership through wave after wave of meteor showers launched by the evil alliance power from the planets Zereal and Xenac. Your job is to blow all alien life forms and meteors to atoms with your phaser canon, but, you had better be quick in your ability to manuever and fire. So, plug your cartridge into Adventure Vision, grab the joystick and get ready for action."

Your mission is to fly your helicopter over 10 different terrains and get the booty at the secret enemy base. It may sound easy but watch out. There are enemy rockets, magnetic space mines, UFOs, and the most treacherous terrain an Ace pilot like you has ever encountered."

      "en": "Based on the Konami arcade game, it's your job to rescue six little turtlettes and take them home. It may sound easy, but you had better watch out because the beetles are after you. Each floor contains eight mystery squares.  Behind six of the squares are those cute little turtlettes. But beware, because the other two contain beetles. If a beetle gets too close you can use the bug bomb, but use them wisely, because you only can use one at a time."
