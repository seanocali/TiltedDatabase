Get shot and you lose your laser base, but as long as you have barriers, you can run under one of them and convert it into another laser base to continue the fight. Run out of them and it's only a matter of time before you become a victim of the Merciless Monstroth.\r\n\r\nThe unusual part of this game is its scoring: if you destroy the robotic armada plus Merciless Monstroth, you earn a point; but if the armada destroys you and all your bases, Merciless wins a point.

If both skiers go off-course, the winner is the skier with the fewest violations.\r\n\r\nTHE SLALOM\r\nYou follow a twisting course defined by pairs of gates. A skier must go between every pair of gates of the same color but may do so from either side. (The colored gates will show up in different shades of gray on black and white TV.) The winner is the skier achieving the fastest aggregate time over two runs down different courses. The courses will change automatically after each run.\r\n\r\nTHE GIANT SLALOM\r\nThis event is longer that the Slalom and the gates are farther apart. Follow the Slalom rules for Giant Slalom competition.\r\n\r\nCombined Competitions A Combined competition represents the final result of several events. They can be similar. (Two Downhills - two Slaloms - etc.) They can be different. (A Downhill and a Slalom, etc.) A Combined Competition can also be any three races in any sequence.\r\n\r\nThe \"Triple Combined\" is the result of a Downhill, A Slalom and a Giant Slalom in any sequence.\r\n\r\nThe \"Alpine Combined\" is the result of one Downhill and one Slalom.

If both hand controls are in use, the winning time will be displayed at the center of the bottom of the screen in the winning skier's colors. This is the time to beat. It will remain there until it is replaced with a better time for the same event.

There are at least two different box and manual versions, one for the main European market, one for the North-European market.\r\n\r\nSince the G7000 didn't have enough RAM memory and computing power for a chess program, Philips decided to equip the chess cartridge with an add-on computer module that sits on top of the G7000 console. The module gets its 5V and 300mA from the main console. The chess program itself resides in an 8244 EPROM chip on the cartridge and is connected via input/output latches to the C7010 CPU's databus. The extra processing power is provided by an NSC800 8Bit CMOS microprocessor running at 4.43 MHz. The C7010 also has 2K of RAM and 8K of ROM (OS or part of the Chess program itself?).\r\n\r\nBesides some logic chips there are two MM82PC12N (output latch and address latch) and an empty socket. This socket was unused on the boards of all the four Chess units I opened so far - maybe there were some other versions planned? The empty socket has all the address lines for another 8K.\r\n\r\nFrom the looks of it the C7010 could have been adapted to run other programs - an interesting possibility. All the C7010s I've seen so far have been of type C7010/05 but the service manual mentions 00, 05, 16, 18, 19 as possible versions - not sure what the differences are. If you have a different version please let me know and send me a scan - thanks! And if you're really brave please open up your C7010 and send me a chip listing - thanks!!!\r\n\r\nIn ads the C7010 was touted as the 'serious' chess cartridge among the various videogame consoles, but it was quite pricey and sold at DM 300 - 400, about 4 - 5 times the price of the Atari 2600 chess cartridge (the famous cheating one) and thus putting it well out of reach of young videogame players and targeting the adults instead.\r\n\r\nThe C7010 manual is very detailed and provides a good introduction to the game of Chess."

The left hand control is shared by players 1 and 3. The right hand control is shared by players 2 and 4. The direction of the joy stick controls the direction the electronic golfers will walk. They will walk in all vertical, horizontal and diagonal directions in accordance with the joy stick's position.\r\n\r\nThe toe of the club must overlap the ball at the start of the backswing. The action button on the hand control unit controls the swing of the club. Press down to start the backswing. The longer you press the action button, the higher the backswing. The distance traveled by the ball is determined by the length of the backswing. If you bring the backswing full circle, the club will release automatically, and the distance the ball travels will be random. Release the action button to hit the ball. The backswing of the club will always be clockwise, and the downswing will always be counter-clockwise. The direction taken by the ball will be dependent on the golfer's position in relation to it. It will be perpendicular to the angle of the toe of the club when it makes contact with the ball.\r\n\r\nYou can walk your electronic golfer away from the ball and take a practice swing to confirm direction. There is no stroke penalty for this. If you are addressing the ball and starting your backswing, but wish to change the position of your electronic golfer - simply walk him away from the ball and release the action button. There is no penalty\r\n\r\nThe player with the lowest score for the nine holes is the winner.\r\n\r\nTo play again, press the RESET key on the console and then press 1, 2, 3 or 4 on the alpha-numeric keyboard.\r\n\r\nCOMPUTER GOLF!

      "en": "CONQUEST OF THE WORLD represents a significant departure from traditional game design. The components have been designed to provide you with a very realistic model of the real world to both electronically and graphically simulate strategic and tactical confrontation between world powers.\r\n\r\nElectronic land, sea and air forces can be deployed against each other in any combination and are totally dependent on supplies which are represented by energy units.\r\n\r\nThe game board is a true-to-life model of the relationships between countries of the real world in the early 1980's.\r\n\r\nForty-three countries have been divided into eleven \"politectonic\" or geo-political zones. Each country has been weighted with a power base figure that reflects its capability to persuade other nations to conform to its wishes - by diplomatic coercion or by direct military force.\r\n\r\nThese figures are based on the formula created by Ray S. Cline, formerly Deputy Director of Intelligence for the C.I.A.\r\n\r\nPp = (C+E+M)x(S+W)\r\n\r\nPERCEIVED POWER = (Critical Mass (Population + Territory) + Economic Capability + Military Capability) x (Strategic Purpose + National Will).\r\n\r\nFuture shifts in world power and change in governments will - of course - make changes in these numeric weightings appropriate. Players can feel free to sustain realism by changing the numbers assigned to each country as life goes on.\r\n\r\nIf you play other war games such as those published by Avalon Hill and SPI, you will find that the computer cartridge interfaces very effectively with them. The onscreen combats will generate much more excitement and realism than the usual dice provided to resolve conflicts. Onscreen energy units can be programmed into the computer to reflect the relative strength between different forces. The differential between the onscreen energy units at the end of each battle can also be applied to the combat results tables that come with these games.\r\n\r\nConquest of the World is the first game of its kind, so be ready for many unusual features. Take the rules one step at a time and you will find it to be a fascinating game of endless challenge - which, once learned, is not at all difficult to explain to others.\r\n\r\nTHE OBJECTIVE OF THE GAME is to lead your Homeland to world domination through negotiations, conquests and alliances. Each successful conquest and alliance you make will strengthen your country's power base. The country with the strongest power base at the end of the game is the winner."

This number will decrease by one every time a direct hit is scored.\r\n\r\nThe number at the lower right of your screen represents the quantums of energy units in your fuel receptors. These energy units are expressed in megajoules.\r\n\r\nYou will start your mission with 1000 megajoules. One megajoule per second is used to sustain flight. A laser burst uses ten megajoules of energy. If an enemy star fighter comes within range and fires, fifty megajoules of energy are required to activate your deflector shields.\r\n\r\nThe objective of your mission is to destroy all 15 units in the enemy fleet using the least number of megajoules.\r\n\r\nManeuver your star fighter with the joy stick on the right hand control unit. Pull it towards you to ascend. Push it away from you to descend. Push right to go right. Push left to go left.

It is important to fix the ship in your sights quickly and fire before he comes within his own firing range and costs you energy units necessary to activate your deflector shields. The star fighters will come at you from a variety of angles. It is safer strategy to outmaneuver the ones that come at you from diagonals. They require very sophisticated precision tracking. You will save megajoules by firing at those that come head-on or appear in more easily tracked vertical and horizontal courses. You can take evasive action from a star fighter only by climbing or diving to get the ship completely off-screen. If you go right or left, the fighter will continue to follow you.\r\n\r\nThere are five enemy star fighters to protect the ten enemy invasion transports and battle frigates.

Different times may be entered for each player to give a novice more of a chance against an experienced player. If you want to play with no time limit, enter 00 on the numeric section of the keyboard.\r\n\r\nIf you are playing against the computer, the microprocessor will make its move instantly. It can make more than 100,000 electronic decisions per second.\r\n\r\nThe object of the game is to occupy as much of the matrix as possible.\r\n\r\nThe game begins with two \"armies\" of each color at the center of the matrix.\r\n\r\nThe game ends when the board is filled or when neither player can enter a move and capture and opposing \"army.\" The player with the most \"armies\" on the matrix is the winner.

The directions may be in any horizontal, vertical or diagonal straight line.\r\n\r\nSecret strategy hints.\r\n- The corners are the most important strategic positions. Once an \"army\" occupies a corner, it controls three directions. An \"army\" commanding a corner position cannot be captured because it cannot be surrounded on two sides in a straight line.\r\n- The outside positions of the matrix are very important because they effect five directions but are only vulnerable from two sides.\r\n- Caution!

It automatically counts down the seconds for a three minute game and only operates during the plays. Digital readouts at either side of the screen show the score for their respective teams. The left hand scoring indicator shows the score for the team at the left side of the field. The right hand scoring indicator shows the score for the team at the right side of the field.\r\n\r\nThe number at the top edge of the field keeps track of the downs and will follow the ball as a yardage marker. It will change colors to indicate the team in possession of the ball.\r\n\r\nThe team at the left side of the field will always have first possession of the ball. Players should alternate hand controls after each game.\r\n\r\nThe offensive team has four down to score on each possession of the ball.\r\n\r\nTouchdown: 7 points\r\nField goal: 3 points\r\n\r\nThe offense has six running/passing option plays available. They differ in the lineup of the team and in the automated running pattern of the wide receiver - the only player eligible to receive a pass.\r\n\r\nThe defense has a selection of plays specifically designed to neutralize the offensive effort. If the defense correctly guesses the offensive play, the wide receiver will automatically be covered by one of the defensive ends and the quarterback will be under maximum pressure from the automated defensive line. Good offensive strategy dictates constantly varying plays in an effort to gain the most yardage.\r\n\r\nIf the offensive captain considers his team to be out of touchdown range on a fourth down, he can elect to try for a field goal. (Play #7 on the hand control.)\r\n\r\nIf the offensive team is deep within its own territory on the fourth down, it is good strategy to go for a punt which will give the team far better defensive positioning when the ball changes hands. Activate play #8 on the hand control.\r\n\r\nPlays are selected by the offensive and defensive teams while the players are in their huddles. The play is selected by moving the joy stick of the hand control to the proper location as indicated on the play selector diagram. While holding the joy stick at this position, each player enters the play into the computer by pressing the action button on the hand control. (If plays are not selected within 25 seconds, play #1 will be activated automatically by the computer.)\r\n\r\nWhen both players have entered their plays into the computer, the player captaining the offensive team hikes the ball to his quarterback by pressing the action button on his hand control.\r\n\r\nThe quarterback of the offensive team is the player just behind the center. He and his wide receiver are easily recognizable by having thinner necks than the rest of the team. The key player on the defensive team is the linebacker. He also is differentiated by having a thinner neck than the rest of the players on his team.\r\n\r\nWhen the play is activated by the player captaining the offensive team, all of the offensive players except the quarterback will go into motion automatically and follow the pattern of the chosen play. The quarterback remains under control of the joy stick of the offensive team's hand control unit.\r\n\r\nThe quarterback has a running or passing option on all plays except #7 (Field goal attempt and #8 (Punt). The horizontal and vertical movement of the joy stick controls his running pattern. Press the action button to fire the pass. The vertical set of the joy stick at the moment you press the action button will determine the direction of the pass. If the joy stick is pushed away from you, the pass will angle towards the top of the screen. Pull the joy stick towards you to angle the pass down screen. Center the joy stick to pass up the middle. (Note: the horizontal position of the joy stick will have no effect on the direction the pass travels.) The pass can only be caught by the wide receiver. The pass is complete if the ball intersects with his automated running pattern. If the pass is complete, the offensive player's joy stick will control the wide receiver instead of the quarterback so that the play can continue. The quarterback can throw a pass any time before reaching the line of scrimmage, indicated by the down marker. If the quarterback should go behind his own goal line, an automatic \"quick kick\" will take place to prevent a safety.\r\n\r\nOn-screen electronic sensors enable the defensive linesmen to follow the ball automatically. They will shift their attention from the offensive quarterback to the wide receiver the moment the ball is passed. The defensive linebacker is the only player capable of making an interception and is under the control of the defense player's joy stick. If an interception is made, the whistle blows, play is stopped and the defensive team has possession of the ball.\r\n\r\nThe player captaining the offensive team may elect to try for a field goal at any time by invoking play #7 on the hand control.\r\n\r\nThe game ends after three minutes have gone by on the clock. Action will be frozen and the team with the highest score is the winner.

The blue Beebots move counterclockwise.\r\n\r\nSting a Beebot by flying over it. The longer your swarm remains in contact, the slower the beebot will travel. A Beebot will be dead and buried after it slows to a standstill. Surviving Beebots will be blocked by the grave markers. If a Beebot is slowed but is no longer being stung, it gradually regains its strength and speeds up.\r\n\r\nThe Beebots are protected by up to three swarms of Killer Bees at any one time. Every time a swarm of Killer Bees makes contact with your swarm, you will lose some of your bees.\r\n\r\nThe longer a swarm of Killer Bees remains on the screen, the more dangerous it becomes. They come out of the tunnel as Green Meanies and start exploring the screen. After a short time they advance to the Blue Bodyguard stage and protectively hover over the Beebots. The final and most dangerous phase of their evolution is the Red Devil stage. Red Devils will aggressively attack your swarm and become faster as the game progresses.\r\n\r\nYour only defense against the Killer Bees is the bug-zapping RoSHa Ray. It will become charged each time your swarm kills a Beebot, and red electrodes will follow the vertical motion of your white swarm. Press the action button to fire the bug zapper. It will instantly disintegrate any swarms to the left or right of your white swarm including those in tunnels or currently stinging your swarm and will not hurt your white swarm.\r\n\r\nYour bug-zapping RoSHa Ray will recharge every time you kill a Beebot. If your zapper is already charged, killing a second Beebot will not allow you two zaps.\r\n\r\nA round ends when you lose all your bees or kill all the Beebots.

To do so, the SIDO (Space Intruder Defense Organisation) infiltrated a fighting probe inside the Martian spaceship.\r\n\r\nIn Martian Threat the player controls a fighting probe with the joystick. The lack of gravity will make the probe keep moving until reverse thrust is given. The player has to shoot Martians and their energy bombs, which will appear in four different spots. The probe can only shoot diagonally. At the start, the Martian bombs are green and have little energy on them. As the game proceeds the bombs turn blue, purple and finally red. The probe can take up to ten hits from green bombs, but only three hits from red bombs. Additionally, the bombs will move faster and when they hit the probe they'll push it away. The probe explodes if it hits the space ship's walls.\r\n\r\nThe game has two possible endings. If the player succeeds in defending the Earth for 64 seconds (77 seconds in PAL systems), the laser defense will be finished and Earth will be saved.

The sharks will eat those nets to get the fish, and if an entire row is destroyed, more sharks will come from the sea. The Eskimo can repair the nets by swimming to the place where they were destroyed. The more nets destroyed, the less fish is kept. A stage will end when all sharks are killed. At the end of each stage the remaining fish will be counted and added to the player's score. As the game progresses, sharks become more abundant and destroy the nets faster.

Parker Brothers licensed the Spider-Man character from Marvel Comics Group in or around 1982 and immediately set out to create video games around him. While the company did manage to release Spider-Man for the Atari 2600, the Philips G7000 version never made it to market.

The net worth of each figure is directly below it. Each player starts off with $500,000. Two Keynesian robots are in the center of the screen atop the maze entrance. Every maze is a game within a game. You and your opponent are playing against the robots which represent different factors of the economy. But you are also playing against each other. You will be changing strategies throughout the game - sometimes cooperating with the robots to thwart your opponent - sometimes collaborating with your opponent to beat the robots.\r\n\r\nEach maze offers you the opportunity to make money or the chance to hang onto what money you have. An electronic signal will appear center screen to tell you which to expect - and how much cash is at stake.\r\n\r\nThe right hand control unit activates the right hand figure. The left hand control unit controls the left hand figure. Push the joy stick away from you to make your player go up. Pull the joy stick toward you to make your player travel downward. Push right to go right. Push left to go left.\r\n\r\nThe Keynesian robots are controlled by the computer. The brighter robots represent the lighter side of the economy like income, bull markets and successful investments. These robots are elusive and will try to run from you - but the more quickly you catch them, the more money you'll make.\r\n\r\nThe darker robots represent the gloomier side of the economy - things like taxes, inflation and bear markets. They will try to catch you wherever you are in the maze. But the longer you stay away from them, the more money you'll keep. It's possible to find a hiding place in the maze where the darker robots can't find you.\r\n\r\nThere are seven kinds of mazes. INCOME, REWARD and INVESTMENT offer you an opportunity to make money. EXPENSES, THIEF, TAXES and INFLATION will force deductions from your net worth unless you completely elude the robots during these maze sequences. The amount of money at stake in each maze will appear at the lower center of the screen. After a moment, the numbers will start decreasing. The dark robots will speed up and the brighter robots will slow down as the $ at stake decrease. The number on the screen at the instant you make contact with a robot will be automatically computed into your net worth.\r\n\r\nYou will find that the Keynesian robots are small enough to maneuver freely through the mazes. But you are too tall to travel through some of the narrow passageways without ducking your head. You do this by pressing the action button on your hand control. It is harder to run in this position, so your player will only be going at two-thirds speed. If you do not press the action button when you make contact with a low ceiling in the maze, the computer will do it for you automatically, but you will only be able to run at half speed.\r\n\r\nThe walls and ceilings of the maze contain a high energy charge. If any part of your player's body comes in contact with any part of the maze, you must break that contact before proceeding with your run.\r\n\r\nDepartment of Dirty Tricks! Once you make contact with a robot, it is good strategy to harass your opponent. If you touch your opponent and a part of the maze at the same time, your opponent will lose control of his player.\r\n\r\nDepartment of Economic Cooperation! If you and your opponent outmaneuver the robots and make them run into each other, they'll automatically return to their starting positions. You'll gain both time and money.\r\n\r\nThe first player to achieve a net worth of more than one million dollars wins. The Keynesians will salute your triumph with a blast of electronic trumpets - and reward you with two tickets on the next time machine scheduled to make a stop in the Twentieth Century.\r\n\r\nShort games. You can play against the clock or with a goal of $750,000 instead of a million.\r\n\r\nLonger games. You can play for any dollar figure you choose.
